# Multivariate Polynomials

A multivariate polynomial is a polynomial with more than one variable. For example, the polynomial $x^2 + 2xy + y^2$ is a multivariate polynomial in the variables $x$ and $y$.

So far within the bootcamp we have worked with univariate polynomials, where we did interpolation with FFT and we made use of quotient polynomials by dividing some polynomial with a vanishing polynomial over some domain.

The degree of a multivariate polynomial is the highest sum of the exponents of the variables in any term of the polynomial. For example, the degree of the polynomial $x^2 + 2xy + y^2$ is 2.
