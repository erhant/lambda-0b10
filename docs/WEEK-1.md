# Week 1

We talked about prime numbers, divisibility. Then we talked about groups, rings, and fields. We also talked about Montgomery form for field elements, and using limbs for that for better performance. In particular, we talked about Mersenne primes and MiniGoldilocks prime, and show how we can have efficient "modular reductions" there. The overall idea is that division & remainder is expensive and we would like to do as few as possible.
