Hey all, Erhan here from Turkey. I'd first heard of Logos around the summer of 2022, my friend who showed it to me had said "these guys are literally building a new & decentralized internet" which I thought was an exaggeration, but at the time I just didn't understand. I've been growing as a developer since; today I'm doing OSS work mostly focused on zero-knowledge cryptography tooling & docs. I am currently working at the intersection of Web3 x AI, where we are building something called "Dria" and one of its components is a decentralized network of compute nodes that run large language models locally, and they communicate using Waku! Other than that, I've been interested in EVM-related security, and do occasionally participate in CTFs.

I'm not the most privacy-concerned person (with a touch of self-consciousness that I should be more concerned), but I am very much interested in the possibility and beauty of how we may achieve that, i.e mathematics. Its like we are making a really good ice cream here, but I'm most interested in the golden spoon that we are going to be using to eat it. I am working hard to grow as a mathematician & a cryptographer, which is an endless journey which makes the fun in it endless as well.

"Cypherpunks write code", I'm here to do just that
